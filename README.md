[![tested with testthat](https://img.shields.io/badge/tested_with-testthat-99424f.svg)](https://github.com/r-lib/testthat) 


An R language wrapper for the new iexcloud market data API from IEX Group Inc. All data is returned dataframes (actually tibbles).

This package is a companion to the NodeJS package [iexcloud_api_wrapper](https://github.com/schardtbc/iexcloud_api_wrapper) 

## Usage

To install as a dependancy into your project at the R REPL command prompt

```r
install.github("schardtbc/iexcloudR")
```

then in your .env file add the following keys

```
IEXCLOUD_API_VERSION = "beta"
IEXCLOUD_PUBLIC_KEY = "pk_..."
IEXCLOUD_SECRET_KEY = "sk_..."

# use the pk and sk obtained from your iexcloud account
# make sure the .env file is in your .gitignore file
# do not hard code the keys into your application code
# do not upload the keys to github.
# you can easily change the keys if they become compromised

Note: when IEXCLOUD_PUBLIC_KEY starts with a "T" ,as in "Tpk= ..." then the base url used will be the sandbox url instead of the production cloud url
```

To test that everything installed correctly and the .env file is properly setup you can use the following or similar code

```r
library(iexcloudR)

historyFor("AAPL")
```
